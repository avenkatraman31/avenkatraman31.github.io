## About me    

I'm a third year Ph.D candidate in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Georiga Institute of Technology Atlanta. My advisor is [Prof. Surya Kalidindi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=C2k6mYwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My research interests are
- Crystal Plasticity and Molecular Dynamics
- Uncertainty Quantification and Propagation, Verification, Validation
- Machine Learning and Reduced Order Models
- Bayesian Calibration 
- Nanoindentation 

My research broadly involves the development and deployment of novel Data Science and Uncertainty Quantification protocols for  accelerating Computational Materials Science investigations. The aim of my research is the development of efficient and accurate tools with the potential to aid materials and product design efforts.  My Ph.D thesis is titled "*Uncertainty Quantification, Verification and Validation and Hierarchical Uncertainty Propagation for - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha+\beta" />  Titanium alloys*". This works entails the development of a comprehensive Uncertainty Quantification framework for physics-based models of Polycrystalline Materials and multi-phase composites. Additionally, I have worked on the following projects during my doctoral candidacy: 
- Identification of fatigue hot-spots in Ti-6Al-4V using Machine Learning and Crystal plasticity Finite Element Modeling (jointly advised by [Dr. David McDowell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=mVYGZ2oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) )
 - Development of Reduced Order Models for Damage initiation in composites using Bayesian Neural Networks 
 - Microstructure sensitive surrogate model development and performance optimization of micro-spring constant using Gaussian Process Regression

I also have a masters degree in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras). I completed my masters thesis titled "*Hydrogen embrittlement in Austenitic stainless steels*", under Prof. Ratna Kumar Annabattula. My research involved the investigation of hydrogen effects on fcc metals at the continuum (J2 plasticity) as well as the mesoscale (crystal plasticity). I developed and implemented User-Material Subroutines (UMATs) to study the effect of hydrogen induced softening on crack tip plasticity and assessed the degradation in toughness. Additionally, I've worked under Prof. Anand Kanjarla on studying the effect of Ni3Al precipitates on the mechanical response of Ni superalloys using Molecular Dynamics simulations. I was fortunate enough to have spent the summer of 2016 as an intern at Purdue University, where I worked on grain refinement and recrystallization in superplastic forming under Prof. Yung Shin. The areas that I'm interested in include:

I am always open to exploring new avenues of research. I regularly attend talks by various professors (my most recent one was "Granular Micromechanics" - by Prof.Anil Misra from the University of Kansas) I hope that one day, I'll be accepted into a premier university for a doctorate. I am an avid reader of fantasy novels. I watch TV shows with an almost religious reverence. I love nature documentaries ("The Tigers of the Sunderbans" is by far, my favourite).
