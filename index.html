  <h2>
   About me
  </h2>
  <p>
   I'm a fifth-year student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Currently, I'm working on my masters thesis titled "
   <em>
    Hydrogen embrittlement in Martensitic stainless steels
   </em>
   ", under Prof. Ratna Kumar. Additionally, I'm working under Prof. Anand Kanjarla on stress assisted diffusion of hydrogen in multi-phase steels. I was fortunate enough to have spent the summer of 2016 at Purdue University, where I worked on grain refinement and recrystallization in superplastic forming under Prof. Yung Shin. The areas that I'm interested in include:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Plasticity and fracture mechanics
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Micromechanics
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Molecular Dynamics
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Multi-scale modeling of materials
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   I am always open to exploring new avenues of research. I regularly attend talks by various professors (my most recent one was "Granular Micromechanics" - by Prof.Anil Misra from the University of Kansas) I hope that one day, I'll be accepted into a premier university for a doctorate. I am an avid reader of fantasy novels. I watch TV shows with an almost religious reverence. I love nature documentaries ("The Tigers of the Sunderbans" is by far, my favourite).
